            <h2>Application Strategy</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Embracing Patience: Understand that job hunting is a process that requires patience and
                    self-compassion. Avoid self-criticism and maintain a positive outlook.</li>
                <li>Exploring Varied Career Paths: Consider alternative paths like internships which can lead to
                    rewarding career opportunities.</li>
                <li>Diversifying Applications: Apply to various roles that match your skills and interests to broaden
