                        <strong>Summary</strong>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            SOMGN combines both undersampling and oversampling to tackle imbalance regression. First the
                            dataset is separated into
                            two groups based on relevance, where high relevance data are target ranges where samples are
                            rare and non-existant, and low relevance
                            are target range where samples are frequent. For irrelevant ranges, they perform
                            undersampling by randomly selecting a percentage of frequent
                            ranges samples from the dataset. For relevant ranges, they combine two oversampling
                            techniques. Given a rare case, they consider k nearest
                            neighbors and calculate the safety distance as half of the median distance between the cases
                            and its neightbors. For all k neighbors within
                            the safety distance, they oversample by interpolating between the case and the safe
                            neighbors. For unsafe distnaces, they add small gaussian
                            noise to the case to produce a synthetic sample. Both oversampling produce very conservative
                            synthetic data.

                            Real world data usually follows a long tail distribution in regression as well where some
                            range of the target have few to no data samples

                            Generate additional synthetic samples where are few or none to compensate.
                            oversample or generating synthetics for non frequent ranges by interpolating if neighbor
                            distance is safe or
                            adding gaussian noise otherwise. undersample frequent target ranges

                            Smoteboost combines generating synthetic samples and boosting to tackle imbalance
                            regression. First they use SMOTE for a prior work to generate
                            new synthetic samples. With the augmented dataset, they use a variant of Adaboost to learn
                            an ensemble of regressors. They use weak models at every iteration that learn
                            from the mistake of the prior iteration models.

                        <strong>Summary</strong>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            This paper tackles that problem of imbalance regression by smoothing the label distribution
                            and the feature distribution.
                            They noticed that the error distribution doesn't correlate with the label distribution like
                            it does in imbalance classification.
                            To tackle this issues, they apply a gaussian kernel convolution operation to the label
                            distribution to smooth it. The kernel size
                            has to be not too small to avoid overfitting and not too large to avoid oversmoothing. With
                            the right kernel size, each target
                            range is smoothed with its neighboring ranges. They also noticed that the feature
                            distribution is not calibrated with the label distribution.
                            To tackle this issue, they collect feature means and variances across bins. They smooth the
                            means and variances based on the
                            neighboring bins means and variances. They then calibrate the original features based on the
                            smoothed means and variances by
                            doing a distribution shift. Their method can be combined with other balancing techniques
                            once the smoothed label distribution
                            is obtained.

                            <strong>Problem</strong>
                            Imbalance regression is a common problem in real world data where some ranges of the target
                            have few to no data samples.
                            Especially, error distribution doesn't correlate with the target distribution like it does
                            in imbalance classification.
                            On top of that, the features distribution is not calibrated with the label distribution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Solution, Ideas and Why</strong>
                            Smooth the label distribution using a gaussion kernel convolution operation to estimate
                            rare/missing ranges based on neighboring ranges.
                            Smooth the feature distribution by collecting feature means and variances across bins,
                            smoothing them, and calibrating the original features based on the smoothed means and
                            variances

                            This paper tackles that problem of imbalance regression by balancing the loss function.
                            First the apply gaussian kernel smoothing to the label distribution
                            to estimate rare/missing ranges based on neighboring ranges. They then obtain a density
                            weighting function by taking the inverse of the smoothed label distribution
                            and normalize all data points density values. Their density function has the following
                            properties:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Samples with more common target values get smaller weights than rarer samples.</li>
                            <li>weighting function yields uniform weights for alpha = 0, while larger alpha values
                                further emphasize the
                                weighting scheme. This provides intuition for the efects of alpha</li>
                            <li>No data points are weighted negatively, as models would try to maximize the diferrence
                                between estimate and true value for these data points during training</li>
                            <li>No weight should be 0 to avoid models ignoring parts of the dataset.</li>
                            <li>The mean weight over all data points is 1. This eases applicability for model
                                optimization with gradient descent as it avoids infuence on learning rates</li>
                        </ul>
                        They apply the density weighting function as a coefficient to any regression loss function to
                        ensure the network to focus an rares ranges.

                            density weighting function takes in the smoothed label distribution and produce a reverse
                            distribution where frequent ranges are weighted lower and rare range higher.

                        <strong>Summary</strong>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            This paper tackles the problem of imbalance regression by balancing the loss function. They
                            obtained a balanced MSE by first assuming that
                            the target distribution is uniform and doing a statiscal transfer from a balance uniform
                            distribution to a original imbalanced distribution
                            during training and testing the model on a balanced distribution. Unfortunately, the
                            statiscal transfer carry an integral that is intractable
                            to compute. They approximate the integral using GAI, BMC or BNI. GAI is GMM-based Analytical
                            integration which uses a gaussian mixture model
                            to approximate the integral. BMC is Batch-based monte carlo that approximate the integral by
                            an average over the batch. BNI is Bin-based numerical
                            integration that approximate the integral by an average over the target bins.

                            train on balanced MSE loss function based on an assumed uniform test distribution.
                            To compute the integral part of the Balance MSE, approximate it using bins, monte carlo

                        <p>
                            This paper is tackling the problem of imbalance regression by calibrating the feature space
                            such that for any sample,
                            the sorted list of its neighbors in the feature space is the same as the sorted list of
                            neighbors in the target space. To achieve that
                            they compute the pairwise similarity matrices for both features samples and labels samples.
                            They then compute the ranking similarity
                            loss between the two matrices. They approximate the ranking function gradient by
                            constructing a family of piece-wise affine continuous
                            interpolations that trade off informativeness of gradient with fidelity to original
                            function. They then use the gradient to update the
                            model parameters.

                            <strong>Problem</strong>
                            Features are not well calibrated where the sorted list of neighbors in the feature space is
                            not the same as the sorted list of neighbors in the target space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Solution, Ideas and Why</strong>
                            Regulariser that encourage for any sample, the sorted list of its neighbors in feature space
                            to match the sorted list of its neighbors in label space.
                            Approximate the ranking function gradient by constructing a family of piece-wise affine
                            continuous interpolations that trade off informativeness of gradient
                            with fidelity to original function.
