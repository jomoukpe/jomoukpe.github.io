                                This paper tackles the problem of predicting >100 MeV SEP events from timeseries of
                                proton and x-ray channels with a decision tree.
                                They first start by analyzing X-ray and proton channels as multivariate time series that
                                entail some correlation which may be precusors
                                to the occurence of SEP. They study the correlation across all channels. In total they
                                have 8 channels xs for short wavelength x-ray (.5 -.3 nm)
                                xl for long wavelength x-ray (.1 - .8 nm), and 6 proton channels p6_flux to p11_flux
                                with different energetic interval from 80MeV to >700MeV.
                                To analyze the correlations in channels, they consider the span and the lag in their
                                observation. The span is the number of hours that constitute
                                the observation period prior to an X-ray event. The lag is the factor by which a vlaue
                                of a time series is multipled to produce its previous value in time.
                                To express the X-ray and proton cross-channel correations, they used a vector
                                autoregression model (VAR) where the dependent variables are the proton channels at t
                                and the independent variables are the proton and x-ray channels at time previous times
                                determined by the lag. After fitting the VAR to the data,
                                they use the coefficient as features to a Decision Tree to predict SEP events based on
                                the assumption that the coefficients values would increase as precursors to the event.

                                This paper analyses the effectiveness of the Richardson Equation (Richardson et al 2014)
                                for predicting intensity of 14-24MeV protons in SEPs using CME
                                speed and connection angle as features. The richardson equation which is I(ùúô)(MeV s ‚ãÖ
                                cm2 ‚ãÖ sr)‚àí1 ‚âà 0.013 exp(0.0036V ‚àí ùúô2‚àï2ùúé2)), ùúé = 43¬∞ where the
                                43¬∞ Gaussian width is the average obtained by Richardson et al. (2014). They found that
                                the Richardson equation leads to a lot of false alarms compared
                                in predicting SEPs. By increasing the threshold for the intensity considered SEP, they
                                found that the false alarm rate reduces but so does the number of
                                SEPs they can actually catch. They then explore using the CME speed for filtering out
                                false alarm rate which yields the same reduction in false alarm rate
                                at the cost of missing SEPs as well. They explore using the CME width as well resulting
                                a variant of the same trade off. They explore using interplanetary
                                and non interplanetary type 2 Radio emissions, weak, moderate, and bright Type 3 Radio
                                emissions power and duration as additional filters. They found
                                these filters reduce the false alarm rate but misses weaker SEPs. They conclude that the
                                richardson equation is decent basis for empirical prediction of SEPs.

                                the richardson equation can be used to predict SEPs only needing CME speed and
                                connection angle.
                                Richardson equation gives a high false positive rate, pairing it with type 2 and 3
                                emissions or only selecting faster and
                                wider CMEs help reduce false alarm rate, but at the cost of missing some SEPs

                                This paper addresses the SEP forecasting with flare X-ray peak ratios. They found that
                                flares associated with >10MeV SEPs of >10 proton flux units have lower peak temperatures
                                than those without SEPs. They first analyze how the ratios of the short (0.05 - 0.4nm)
                                and long (0.1 - 0.8nm) wavelengths x-rays peak fluxes and peak flare fluxes of long
                                wavelengths are useful features for distinguishing SEP events of greater intensity
                                against lower energy and background events. They further analyzed the Eastern and
                                Western hemisphere events and found that the Western hemisphere events are better
                                classified by the peak-flux ratios and peak fluxes. Using the peak flux ratio between
                                the short and long wavelength and the peak fluxes of the long wavelength x-ray as

                                This paper tackles the prediction of SEP events using Solar Radio Flux. By looking at
                                Solar Radio Flux (SRF) at 2800MHz, 1415MHz, and 610MHz,
                                they analyze the solar activity related to those fluxes and the SEPs that might be
                                related. First the analyze the probability distribution on the relative
                                overall rate of increase of SRF related to SEPs and found that a significant increase in
                                the rate of SRF was correlated to an increase in the number of SEPs.
                                They also look at the probability distribution of daily total SRF related to SEPs and
                                found that an increase in the SRF level was correlated to increase in the
                                number of SEPs when only looking at SEPs. Moreoever, the 610MHz band seems to be the
                                earliest and highest correlated precursor to SEP events. Using these findings,
                                they pass all 3 bands SRF rate of increase and the daily total SRF level as features to
                                a Neural Network to predict the number of SEPs. They propose to find the
                                neural network optimal weights using gradient descent or a Genetic Algorithm. Finally
                                the propose a second neural network that is tasked to predict SRF to generate
                                more recent data (within 3 days) if it's not available.

                                This paper tackles predicting whether Solar Flares will be associated with CME and SEPs.
                                First they start by comparing the number of events associated with
                                Solar Flares alone compared to solar flares with CME and SEPs. They found that Solar
                                Flares associated with CMEs and SEPs tend to have higher classes. They also
                                compared the number of events associated with the speed of CMEs when they are alone and
                                when they are with Solar Flares and SEPs. Again they found that
                                CMEs associated with Solar Flares and SEPs tended to have higher speeds. They also
                                consider Active Regions which are regions of high magnetism. Active regions
                                have been known to generate SEPs. The authors considered features from active regions at
                                some time in the past to predict current SEP events. They employed a SVM and
                                a MLP to ingest those features to output the right class. THey found that the SVM tended
                                to be more accurate than the MLP.

                                This thesis tackle SEP forecasting based using Proton, Electrons and X-ray timeseries
                                data. Their approach takes as input
                                electron and proton intensities 2hours in the past to output proton intensity in 30mins
                                and an hour in the future. They also add phases
                                information to every 5min timestep as additional input features. The phases are the
                                onset, threshold, peak, and end periods. They applied
                                an MLP and RNN to the forecasting task. They divide their forecasting into 3 levels
                                where a model (MLP or RNN) is dedicated to train and test
                                on that level only. To decide which of the levels is appropriate for each model, they
                                employ either routing algorithm based on predefined thresholds
                                and with the models only focusing on the intensity levels associated with them or use a
                                phase selection model route the timeseries intensities to
                                the different phase models. They add X-rays to the electron data as additional features.
                                To measure the performance of the approaches, they measure
                                Mean Absolute Error between the actual and predicted intensities, the lag between the
                                prediction and the actual intensity forecast between the on-set and peak,
                                the onset and the threshhold, to measure the detection of the rising edge and of the
                                precursory intensity signal respectively. Finally they measure the
                                difference between when the target and and when prediction reaches individually reach
                                ln(10).

                                This paper tackles the prediction of SEP events using short and long wavelength X-rays
                                and 24 Solar Flare features such as cosine and sine of the heliolongitude, peak flux and
                                fluence etc.
                                For their classifier, the authors used an ensemble of 3 MLP whose outputs are averaged.
                                They analyze the relationship between X-ray peak fluxes in the long band and the number
                                of SEPs in the dataset
                                to find that More SEPs are related to more intense X-rays. They artificially balance the
                                dataset and found that their method achieve good performance
                                on the balanced dataset. To further analyze the performance of their model, they only
                                focus on type M2 solar flares and found that the uncertainty associated with Solar
                                Flares
                                of M2 ang greater class is larger in their method. They analyze the decision threshold
                                of their method and found it to be best at around .79 for Solar Flares of C1 and above,
                                and .5 for
                                solar Flares of class M2 and above.

                                This paper approaches the prediction of SEPs using CME and Solar Flare features. The
                                authors start with an initial sample analysis where they find that
                                for about 33,221 Solar Flare events, 6218 are CMEs and only 257 are SEPs, illustrating
                                the extreme imbalance in the data. Before applying any model to the
                                data, they preprocess it and extract 8 features, 6 Solar Flare features and 2 CME
                                features. They then normalize the features or apply the logarithm to make sure that
                                the values and ranges of those features are manageable. They apply a Nested Cross
                                Validation scheme where there is the inner folds for finding hyperparameters
                                for the models and the outer folds for testing the found hyperparameters. It works by
                                first spliting the dataset in K folds. They hold on out for testing and use the k-1
                                folds for training.
                                Of the K-1 folds, the perform another n-folding where they divide the combined k-1 folds
                                into n folds. They hold n one out for validation and train on the remaining n-1 folds.
                                They train 8 machine learning including Linear models, SVMs, Neural Nets, and Decision
                                Trees algorithms compare their relative performance in balanced and imbalanced settings.
                                No clear winner
                                can be declared as the algorithms trade wins over different metrics. They analyze the
                                importance of the given features in the classification, finding out that Solar Flare
                                fluence, CME speed and width are the most useful to predict SEPs.

                                This paper addresses SEPs forecasting using SMARP Features and Solar Flare features.
                                They first analyze Active Regions (AR) which are regions of high magnetic
                                fields, and how these regions are related to Solar Flares and SEPs. They track 5 AR
                                properties and 2 Solar Flare properties which are used as inputs to a Linear Model
                                and an SVM. They train and test their models using balanced as well as imbalanced data,
                                where the balancing is done by oversampling the rare samples. They found that
                                they obtained the best performance by leveraging a subset of features from SMARP and
                                Solar Flares that were the most discerning of SEP events. They found that the
                                flares features performed better then the SMARP Active Region featuers. They also
                                observe that the performance of the algorithms would drop significantly as the level
                                of imbalance in training and testing increased.

                                This thesis tackles the forecasting SEPs from non-SEPs and the intensity of the SEPs.
                                For classifying SEPs using CME features,
                                they explore 3 methods, oversampling the minority classes to obtain a more balanced
                                dataset, apply classifier retraining (cRT) and
                                an auto-encoder head to learn better features during the first stage (cRT+AE). For
                                cRT+AE, they estimate the coefficient contribution of
                                the auto-encoder loss to ensure both branches are equally valued in the training. They
                                found cRT+AE to perform the best in their experiments.
                                For predicting the SEP natural logarithm intensity, they explore 6 methods, oversampling
                                the minority ranges, retraining the regressor (rRT), adding an auto-encoder
                                head to learn better features during the first stage (rRT+AE), integrating the
                                Richardson equation prediction by linear combination or by using the neural network to
                                predict an adjustment error term to the Richardson prediction, and applying dense loss
                                reweighting to the loss function so the training model pays more attention
                                to rare samples. They evaluate their performance using Mean Absolute Error and Pearson
                                Correlation Coefficient. They found that rRT+AE with either dense loss or Richardson
                                adjustment error yielded the best results.

                                Posner's study addresses the need for a reliable forecasting method that can predict the
                                arrival and intensity of hazardous solar energetic particle (SEP) events with a lead
                                time sufficient to mitigate radiation risks for astronauts and spacecraft. The study
                                establishes a methodology using relativistic electron data to forecast the onset and
                                intensity of SEP protons at energies above 30-50 MeV, which can penetrate spacesuits and
                                spacecraft shielding. By analyzing SEP events from 1996-2002, Posner demonstrates that
                                relativistic electrons consistently arrive 30-60 minutes before hazardous SEP protons,
                                and their intensity rise times are correlated, depending on the magnetic connection
                                angle between the observer and the flare location. A forecasting matrix is developed
                                using the electron intensity and maximum rise time parameter to predict the proton
                                intensity 60 minutes in advance. The matrix, derived from historic data, is tested on
                                events from 2003, demonstrating a high success rate in predicting hazardous SEP events
                                with a low false alarm rate. This forecasting method provides a reliable solution for
                                short-term SEP event prediction, enabling timely mitigation of radiation risks for human
                                spaceflight and robotic missions.

                                <strong>Problem</strong>
                                Current forecasting methods for solar energetic particle (SEP) events do not provide
                                sufficient advance warning time for protons at energies that pose a radiation hazard to
                                humans and spacecraft
                            </p>

                                <strong>Solution, Ideas and Why</strong>
                                Relativistic electrons (0.3-1.2 MeV) consistently arrive 30-60 minutes before hazardous
                                SEP ions (>30 MeV), providing a reliable precursor for advance warning.
                                The rise times of both electron and proton intensities are correlated and depend on the
                                magnetic connection angle between the observer and the flare location, with
                                well-connected events showing faster rise times.
                                A forecasting matrix is developed using the electron intensity and maximum rise time
                                parameter to predict the proton intensity 60 minutes in advance.
